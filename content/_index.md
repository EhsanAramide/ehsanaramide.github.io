**To … put it metaphorically, neutrality does not give us a free ride. It throws us into the issues and requires us to swim through them under our own power. This can be difficult and frightening (thus Kant’s injunction, sapere aude) but it also makes us feel empowered to decide for ourselves.** _Why Neutrality?, Essays on Free Knowledge, [Larry Sanger](https://larrysanger.org/)._

**The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.**
_Holy Bible, Proverbs 13:4_

**The knower of truth shall walk the earth as a Madman or a Child.** _My Brother, Arwin the Jesus_
