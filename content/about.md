The person who loves **knowlegde**.

I am Ehsan Aramide, _Physics_ student at [K. N. Toosi University](https://en.kntu.ac.ir). I am extremely intersted in _Complex Systems_ and understading chaotic behavior of biological systems. As a Physics student, I also love `$Mathematics$` and `$Computer Science$` because I believe in Galileo Galilei's words that told us "Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe".

I love:
- listening to musics (especially Rock&Roll, Symphonic Metal, and Epical Musics)
- hiking in nature or city
- reading in quiet places
